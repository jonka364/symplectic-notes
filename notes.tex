\maketitle
These are my notes on symplectic geometry and classical mechanics, based on a course by Tobias Osborne given in the winter semester 2017-2018 at the Leibniz Universität Hannover. I watched the lectures on YouTube, and I strongly recommend them. Not only might these notes contain misunderstandings introduced by me (and for which I take responsibility); they are also not particularly complete, since I made no attempt to write down everything that was said in the lectures. Rather I made notes for my own use, selectively writing down what I felt I needed to read later. Caveat lector.

\section*{Lecture 9: Cotangent bundles are symplectic}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Then its cotangent bundle $T^\bullet M$ is again a smooth manifold. If the functions $x_i$ are coordinates on (some subset of) $M$, then a section of $T^\bullet M$ can be written uniquely as
$$
\xi = \sum_i \xi_i(x_1, \dots, x_n) dx_i,
$$
where the $\xi_i$ are smooth functions of the $x_i$. Here we are thinking of the cotangent bundle as a sheaf of $1$-forms. To get the total space of the bundle, we promote the $\xi_i$ to coordinates. It then remains to work out how they behave under changes of coordinates. By definition, two $1$-forms are equal if they are equal as maps from tangent vectors to numbers. 


Next, we claim that there is an intrinsically defined $1$-form
$$
\alpha = \sum_i \xi_i dx_i,
$$
called the tautological $1$-form. As an example, let's take $M=\mathbb{R}^2$ away from the origin and let's work out $\alpha$ in both Cartesian and polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates we have
$$
\alpha = \xi_x dx + \xi_y dy
$$

\section*{Lecture 13: Symplectic fields and flows}
Let $X$ be a vector field on $(M,\omega)$. Then $X$ is called symplectic if $\mathscr{L}_X \omega = 0$. Recall that a vector field is called Hamiltonian if it arose from a function $H$ on $M$ via
$$
\omega (X_H, \cdot) = dH.
$$
By a calculation, any Hamiltonian field is symplectic. More specifically, let $i_X\omega = \alpha_X$. Then
$$
d\alpha_X = \mathscr{L}_X \omega.
$$
Hence a vector field $X$ is symplectic if and only if its corresponding $1$-form $\alpha_X$ is closed, and it is Hamiltonian if and only if $\alpha_X$ is exact. Thus the relation between symplectic and Hamiltonian vector fields is precisely the relation between closed and exact $1$-forms. We know from de Rham theory that this hinges on the topology of $M$, specifically $H^1(M)$. As for flows, $\operatorname{exp}(tX)$ preserves $\omega$ if and only if $X$ is symplectic. \\
Turning now to the special case of cotangent bundles, suppose $M$ is an arbitrary manifold and $X$ a vector field on $M$. Then there is a unique lift of $X$ to a vector field $X_\#$ on $T^\bullet M$, and this field is always Hamiltonian with 
$$
H = i_{X_\#}\alpha,
$$
where $\alpha$ is the tautological $1$-form on $T^\bullet M$.

\section*{Lecture 17: The Darboux-Weinstein theorem}
This states that symplectic manifolds have no local invariants beyond the dimension. 

\section*{Lecture 18: The Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem}
If a sympectic manifold is equipped with a continuous group action, we can sometimes take a quotient by the group action and obtain a smaller symplectic manifold. Suppose the symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ is acted on symplectically by a Lie group $G$, that is, there is a smooth group homomorphism $\psi: G \rightarrow \operatorname{Sympl}(M)$. Suppose also that there is a compatible moment map $\mu: M \rightarrow \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ to the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$, compatibility meaning that
$$
\mu \circ \psi (g) = \operatorname{Ad}^\ast_g \circ \mu
$$
for every group element $g$.
(TODO: find that comment about the cohomology assumptions on G)
Then $G$ stabilizes the level set $\mu^{-1}(0) \subset M$


\section*{Lecture 19: Properties of the moment map}
\subsection*{The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem}
Let $(M, \omega)$ be a compact, connected symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action by a torus $G = T^m$ and let $\mu: M \rightarrow \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ be the moment map. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The level sets of $\mu$ are connected;
\item The image of $\mu$ is the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of the action.
\end{enumerate}
In view of this, the image of $\mu$ is called the \emph{moment polytope} of the action. Note that $\mathfrak{g}^\ast \cong \mathbb{R}^n$ is a real vector space so the notion of convex hull makes sense. 

\subsection*{Liouville measure}
On a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, the top exterior power $\omega^n = \wedge^n \omega$ is nondegenerate, hence a volume form. The normalized quantity $\omega^n/n!$ is called the Liouville measure. If $X$ is a Hamiltonian vector field on $M$, so that $\mathscr{L}_X \omega = 0$. Then (by Leibniz) $\mathscr{L}_X \omega^n = 0$ also, so Hamiltonian flows preserve the Liouville measure. In particular this is true for the time evolution of a dynamical system, which is Liouville's theorem. 
\subsection*{Duistermaat-Heckman measure}
Suppose that $M$ is compact so that in particular 
$$
\int_M \frac{\omega^n}{n!} 
$$
is finite. Then for any moment map $\mu:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ we can push Liouville forward to a measure on $\mathbb{R}$, called the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. 

Now suppose that we have a circle action on $M$, i.e. that the flow $\sigma_t = \operatorname{exp}(tX)$ is periodic.
